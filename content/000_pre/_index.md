## What you need to get started!

If you are doing this workshop as part of an AWS event, you will be provided an AWS Account.

To login to that AWS Account, you will be given a unique **hash**, something as below:

*b76bbe879*

To login - open a web browser,  navigate to https://dashboard.eventengine.run/ and enter the **hash** to proceed.

Once logged in you will see the event Engine dashboard, for most of this lab we will be
using a preconfigured IDE streamed to your browser using AppStream. To launch the 
environment, click on the **IDE** link in the **Modules** section of the dashboard.
