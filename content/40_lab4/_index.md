## Execute the test.

* In this lab, we'll use the `-k` flag with `taskcat test run` to retain the CloudFormation stack after the test is complete.

`taskcat test run -k`

## Launch the application after deployment.

* Once the taskcat test completes, navigate to the CloudFormation console by clicking...
